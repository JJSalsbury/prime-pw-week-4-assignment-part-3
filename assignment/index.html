    <ul>
    <!-- Create an unordered list with any questions you have -->
   <li>Does a function always have to return something? When building the addItem function, I noticed that my functions would execute, but if I did not return anything (in this case I used a console log in the function) it would still execute the function and return undefuned when I called the function from within a console log. I had to take it out of the console log and just call it to remove the undefined. Why did this happen?</li>
   <li>//I know how and when to use  template literal and would normally use them, but for this weeks assignments, I needed to see that the values were being passed to the console to ensure I understood what was happening. Otherwise, values are passed as a string and it made it difficut in some instances understand what was happening when trouble-shooting and correcting my code. I wanted to include this somewhere...</li>
